# UNR-HardwareTrojanDetectionUsingGameTheory
Hardware Trojan Detection using a Game Theoretic Approach. Written in Python.

This project builds on the already published research https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7885541 in IEEE transactions.
The project thinks about the intelligent decision making on the part of the attacker and defender using a game theory model. 
Along with that an aspect of prospect theory is also used to provide weightage to specific strategies based on an initial 
learning stage that works on Bayes Theorem.
